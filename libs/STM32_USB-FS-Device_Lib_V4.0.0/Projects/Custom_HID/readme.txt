Example description
===================
This Demo provides a description of how to use the USB-FS-Device on the STM32F10xxx, 
STM32F37xxx, STM32F30xxx and STM32L15xxx devices.
The STM32 device is enumerated as HID compliant device, that uses the native PC 
Host USB-FS-Device HID driver.

To test the example, you need to:

  1)- Start the "USB HID Demonstrator" PC applet and connect STM32 USB to PC
  2)- The device should be detected and shown in the USB HID target box
  3)- Press Graphic View button
  4)- You can Select "use SET_FEATURE" or "use SET_REPORT" in order to use SET_REPORT request to send HID Report
       for LED control
  5)- Make sure that following report ID are configured: LED1 ID (0x1) , LED2 ID(0x2),
       LED3 ID(0x3), LED4 ID(0x4), and BUTTON1_ID(0x5)
  6)- Select Leds to switch on/off on the EVAL board => a SET_REPORT request will be sent
	   
More details about this Demo implementation is given in the User manual 
"UM0424 STM32F10xxx USB development kit", available for download from the ST
microcontrollers website: www.st.com/stm32

Hardware environment
====================
This example runs these STMicroelectronics evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware: 

- STM3210B-EVAL
- STM3210E-EVAL
- STM32L152-EVAL
- STM32F373C_EVAL
- STM32F303C_EVAL
- STM32L152D-EVAL

To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP1 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP14 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3. 

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumpers JP18 and JP19 should be connected. 
     - Jumper JP17 should be connected in position 5-6 (PB12 connector)
     - Note that JoySitck Right and Left buttons are used for this Demo.
	 
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up 
	 - LCD Glass should be mounted On IO position for Potentiometer usage.
	 - JP13 should be connected to ADC input. 

  - STM32F373C_EVAL  Set-up 
      - None. 

  - STM32F303C_EVAL  Set-up 
      - None.
