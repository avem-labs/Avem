Example description
===================
This Demo presents the implementation of a device firmware upgrade (DFU) capability
in the STM32F10xxx, STM32F37xxx, STM32F30xxx and STM32L15xxx microcontrollers. It follows the DFU class 
specification defined by the USB Implementers Forum for reprogramming an application 
through USB-FS-Device. 
The DFU principle is particularly well suited to USB-FS-Device applications that 
need to be reprogrammed in the field.

More details about this Demo implementation is given in the User manual 
"UM0424 STM32F10xxx USB development kit", available for download from the ST
microcontrollers website: www.st.com/stm32


Directory contents
==================
 + \binary_template: contains a set of sources files that build the application 
                     to be loaded with DFU 
 + \inc: contains the Demo firmware header files
 + \EWARM: contains preconfigured project for EWARM toolchain
 + \RIDE: contains preconfigured project for RIDE toolchain
 + \MDK-ARM: contains preconfigured project for MDK-ARM toolchain
 + \TASKING: contains preconfigured project for TASKING toolchain  
 + \TrueSTUDIO: contains preconfigured projects for TrueSTUDIO toolchain          
 + \src: contains the Demo firmware source files


Hardware environment
====================
This example runs these STMicroelectronics evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to any other hardware: 

- STM3210B-EVAL
- STM3210E-EVAL
- STM32L152-EVAL
- STM32F373C_EVAL
- STM32F303C_EVAL
- STM32L152D-EVAL

To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, uncomment
the corresponding line in platform_config.h file.

Note: After each device reset, hold down the Key push-button on the STM3210B-EVAL 
      or STM3210E-EVAL or STM32L152D-EVAL or STM32F373C-EVAL evaluation boards or the Up push button 
      on STM32L152-EVAL evaluation board to enter the DFU mode.

  - STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP1 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up 
     - Jumper JP14 (USB disconnect) should be connected in position 2-3.

  - STM32L152-EVAL Set-up 
     - None.
     - Note that the JoyStick Up push button is used to enter DFU mode.
 
  - STM32L152D-EVAL Set-up 
     - None.
     
  - STM32F373C-EVAL Set-up 
     - None.

  - STM32F303C-EVAL Set-up 
     - None.
